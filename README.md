# NPPES-API-Data

A script to pull data from the NPPES(National Plan & Providers Enumeration System) NPI Registry using their API. 

https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/search

It can pull upto 200 Records using a list of NPIs (National Provider Identifier). This is used for the Health Care Providers info.

Once a list of NPIs are provided in the script, running it will create a csv for use in the Healthcare Field.
